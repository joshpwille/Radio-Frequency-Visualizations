# ðŸ“¡ RF Visualization Playground

Welcome to the **RF Visualization Playground** â€” a collection of Python-based simulations to help you explore and visualize fundamental concepts in **Radio Frequency (RF)** and **Electromagnetics**.

These scripts are built for clarity and flexibility. Each one runs with reasonable default values, but you're encouraged to modify the parameters directly in the code to match your own experiments, systems, or course material.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Included?

Each script focuses on a core RF phenomenon:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Different Antenna Radiation Patterns.py` | Visualizes how different antenna types radiate energy (e.g., dipole, Yagi, etc.) |
| `EMI Shielding Effectiveness vs Frequency.py` | Simulates how well materials block RF energy at various frequencies |
| `Multipath Fading in Urban RF Channel.py` | Shows the signal fluctuations caused by multiple RF paths (urban environment) |
| `RF Attenuation vs Distance & Frequency.py` | Models free-space path loss and attenuation over distance and frequency |
| `Skin Depth vs Frequency & Conductivity.py` | Calculates how deep RF energy penetrates into conductive materials |
| `Standing Wave Distance vs Length.py` | Displays standing wave patterns along a transmission line |
| `Standing Wave with Attenuation.py` | Shows how losses affect standing wave intensity |
| `Standing Wave Reflection at Complex Load.py` | Simulates mismatched loads using complex impedance and visualizes reflections |
| `Wave Propagation Through Dielectric.py` | Models wave behavior through layered dielectrics with custom epsilon and sigma values |
